        <h1>August 2021 – summer leadership summit’21</h1>

        <p>
          In alignment with Peniel Day Foundation's vision to support
          adolescents in prisons on the streets with the aim shining the light
          of Jesus to these ones, we received an invite for partnership with the
          Word Assembly church, (The Leaders' Place) Ogba-Lagos, at the Summer
          Leadership Summit held between 2nd and 15th 2021. The summit aimed at
          helping pre-teens and adolescents discover how to journey through
          life, hence, equipping them with non-academic courses such as purpose
          discovery, self-mastery, leadership, sex education, book review,
          games, business strategy, basic health and safety skills amongst
          others.
        </p>

        <p>
          PDF supported the leadership summit through donations to sponsor the
          procurement of a book titled ‘Now I Know’ and authored by Pastor
          Bamidele Abiodun of the Word Assembly Church, (The Leaders' Place)
          Ogba, Lagos. The book provides detailed account of essential lessons
          he learnt from his journey of fifty years, and is to be reviewed at
          certain periods during the summit to grasp and apply the principles on
          pertinent issues in all aspect of life. Also, a representative from
          PDF took part in facilitating designated sessions during the course of
          the program. On the 5th and 9th of August, our representative
          facilitated sessions on character development focusing on influences
          of character traits, character formation, distinction between
          personality traits and character traits, nurturing godly character
          traits and to establish the importance of character formation.

        <p>
          A total of (45) adolescents were impacted during the program and
          received the book titled ‘Now I Know’. Certificates of participation
          were awarded to all punctual and committed participants, as well as
          gift items to the outstanding ones.
        </p>

        <p>
          We appreciate the opportunity to partner with the Word Assembly Church
          (The Leader's Place), in making this year's summit a huge success.
