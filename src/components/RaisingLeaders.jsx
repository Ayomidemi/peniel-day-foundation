          <h1>The inspiration behind peniel day.</h1>

          <p>
          To raise involves responsiveness, nurturing, mentoring, protection, and many other
qualities you desire to add to the list. Whether by a biological parent, foster parent, a
teacher, coach, or caregiver, it brings great joy and fulfillment to watch an individual
you had invested time, resources, and skills in the right environment to become a great
leader. It's such a profound privilege to be raised in a conducive environment affording
the overall development of a young person without inhibiting his or her individuality.
          </p>

          <p>
          While on the other hand, It's quite unfortunate being raised in an environment with
little or no opportunity that permits such an individual to reach his or her potential.
One phrase that stuck with me during the maiden event of the Peniel Day Foundation
program was “Raising leaders”, which happened to be the slogan of the church that
hosted the organization. Calling to mind the categories of children the organization
seeks to focus on, I had to pull out my thinking cap, considering these thoughts:
Have you ever compared the experiences of children raised by a single parent
and by both parents? A two-sided story but a different ball game.
          </p>

          <p>
          Have you tried listening to children raised in dysfunctional families and the
ordeal they have had to put up with?
How about those without foster or parental care? Those on the streets are also
not left out, trying to make ends meet either legitimately or illegitimately.
Have you thought about those who are incarcerated? Deprived of the joys and
adventure of being
Whether by choice or by fate, these different categories of individuals are subjected to
be raised either consciously or unconsciously under the influence of some kind of
environment they find themselves. However, the impact of such an environment unveils
the kind of individual he or she turns out to be later in life.
          </p>

          <p>
          Some years ago, while advocating for child protection, my attention had been called to
some children and young adults remanded in a “correctional home” under a religious
sect. The intent was hoped that individuals who pass through certain rites in the home
would be re-integrated into their families and back into society. Meanwhile, the reverse
was the case. Individuals placed in this facility had been severely dehumanized through
a cascade of experiences that had left them with scars of regret, life-threatening
diseases, some are more deviant and hardened than they were, some have become
victims of bullying, others laden with fear, insecurity, and uncertainty of what trial
awaits them.
          </p>   

          <p>
          Recognizing this, Peniel Day seeks to restore hope, rebuild lives, lighten their world
from gloominess, and giving them a reason to smile wide through the light of the gospel,
counseling, mentoring, and education sponsorship. Accomplishing this task requires
partnership and sponsorship from well-meaning stakeholders who are willing to
support Peniel Day Foundation in shining God's light to vulnerable population
irrespective of their environment, in a way that allows for overall development and
maximizing their potentials.
          </p>

          <p>
          In the end, these may breathe a sigh of relief and fulfillment of the beautiful future that
awaits them.
